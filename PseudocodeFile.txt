# PSEUDOCODE FOR MY PROJECT: Locating UCE cores and flanking regions

# Download Phyluce:
# What Phyluce does â€“ aligns assembled contigs back to their associated UCE loci, 
removes duplicate matches, creates a taxon-specific database of contig-to-UCE matches, 
and includes UCE loci from a known genome as outgroup sequences. (e.g. the chicken (Gallus gallus))

# Make sure Anaconda is in my $PATH ??  I checked for python, but Anaconda isn't coming up
# python -V (in terminal)

# Add the Faircloth lab binstar repository to my .condarc ??
# conda config --add channels http://conda.binstar.org/faircloth-lab

# Install Phyluce
# conda install phyluce





# Find UCE sequences:
# Download UCE contigs ?? available on Dryad (http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.sd080)
# UCE contigs used in analyses are also available from Genbank (accessions: JQ328245 - JQ335930, KC358654 - KC403881)

# Do I need to filter for anything ?? (software: Illumiprocessor, Sickle)
# I don't think so.. the contigs have already been filtered, right?



#Find where UCE probes are:
# LASTZ matches of probes to species-specific contigs ?? available on Dryad (http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.sd080)




# After I download UCE sequences and align all loci for all species, I will align probe sequences to these loci ??
# Then I will determine where the UCE cores vs. flanks are located

# If I have time after these steps, I will compare UCE alignments of cores and flanks across species
# Or I could start by just comparing alignments of cores and flanks between two species 
that are representative of adaptive / non-adaptive radiations (e.g. hummingbird/violetear and mousebird)
